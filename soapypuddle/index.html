                  My final project explores an act that creates an ever changing result. I’ve always been interested in the painting style “tachisme” which is a form of action painting and how something so spontaneous can capture a larger than life feeling. Playing around with the concept of actions and performance, I have grown increasingly interested in a static sculpture that has an action listed in the material list, causing the viewer to imagine the action. As each person comes from an extremely diverse and unique background, the action mentally conjured is specific enough to paint a picture in the viewer's head that is incredibly personal. 

This piece is a continuation of my online web presence which is increasingly chaotic and disconnected. The title of the video on youtube “soapypuddle.mp4” is a reference to quickly uploaded video files out of error. In some ways, I imagine someone being confused as to 1. Why was this created and 2. Was this a mistake upload? adding to the chaotic and ever changing landscape of youtube. 

The piece plays with a bit of anti institutionalism also in regards to doing something against rigidity of daily life. The internet is a place that we are trying to make real. We are trying to digitally program physics into a computer and create a real world that blurs the lines between reality and digitality. What happens when the strict and rigid nature of our world is programmed into computers and we lose the freedom of being able to interact in unexpected and loose ways? This is visible in AI when you ask it to create something ugly – It refuses, stating its purpose is to create useful things that are non-offensive. 

In a world of productivity and progression, it feels wrong to do something ‘pointless’ that brings you joy. Hopefully, this video allows AI to have some fun once in a while.
