            North American creative, Owen&numsp;Dunnigan, established themselves in the prairies discovering transdisciplinary
            methods to construct and deconstruct projects during university. Usually developing around institutional
            critique or responding to current events, compositions balance the scale of organic and geometric/manufactured
            forms with colour. Most works revolve expressions of education, loss, nature, and ephemerality usually set in
            photo, text, print, books and paper, or found materials. Working from large scale projects to simpler
            constructions, they seek to raise different questions depending on personal backgrounds and instill a sense of
            curiosity to research, ideas, or the materials used.</p>
